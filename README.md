Devtank Production Tester Lib
=============================

This is a generic framework for making production testers.

Test scripts are written in Python and results are inserted into a SQL
database.


This code has grown sometimes under very rapid timelines and is used in
anger on multiple projects. There is much Devtank would like to do to
it, but for now, it does the job. It is "work in progress".
